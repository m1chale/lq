# LogSeq CLI Tool

A simple command-line tool that brings [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) to your terminal.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Why This Tool Exists

As a software developer, I often find myself jumping between terminals, code, and notes.  
I use Logseq to keep track of ideas, shortcuts, and project notes ‚Äî but reaching for the mouse or switching out of the terminal always broke my flow.

So I built **`lq`**, a simple CLI companion tool.  
It lets me search, read, and open my notes directly from the terminal ‚Äî no context switching, no mouse, just focus.

## üí° Examples

# Installation

## install `lq`

A helper script called `release.sh` is included in the project root.
It compiles the tool and moves the binary into `~/bin/`.

> Make sure that `~/bin/` is included in your **PATH**, so that the `lq` command is available in your terminal.

If you prefer, you can always compile the binary manually and move it wherever you like.

## install tab completion script

To enable shell completions, copy the `_lq` completion script for your shell from
`shell-completions/<your-shell>/` into your local completions folder:

```
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
cp shell-completions/zsh/_lq ~/.zsh/completions/
```

Then add the following lines to your `~/.zshrc` (if not already present):

```
echo 'fpath=("$HOME/.zsh/completions" $fpath)' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'autoload -Uz compinit && compinit' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```
